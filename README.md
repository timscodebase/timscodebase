# Hi! I'm Tim Smith

## I'm a Husband, Developer, and Lover of Life!

### My passion in life is creating. I'm a kickass web developer, so... I build a lot of websites. Go figure, right? I create small pixel-perfect personal websites, fun, quirky web apps, and I also create enterprise-ready e-commerce solutions. My creative brain loves to solve any puzzle and solve problems.
