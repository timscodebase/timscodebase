# Hi! I'm Tim Smith

## I'm a Husband, Developer, and Lover of Life!

### My passion in life is creating. I'm a kickass web developer, so... I build a lot of websites. Go figure, right? I create small pixel-perfect personal websites, fun, quirky web apps, and I also create enterprise-ready e-commerce solutions. My creative brain loves to solve any puzzle and solve problems.

My brain works differently than most. Because of this, traditional education is not for me. I have taken a few college courses, but I have learned most of what I know through self-study and experimentation (reverse engineering others websites). I have a passion for learning and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay current in this rapidly changing landscape.
