# Hi! I'm Tim Smith

## I'm a Husband, Developer, and Lover of Life!

I'm a passionate web developer who thrives on building creative and functional web experiences.  I leverage my expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Svelte, and Node.js to craft:

Pixel-perfect personal websites
Interactive and engaging web apps
Scalable e-commerce solutions
I'm a problem-solver at heart, and my love for learning fuels my drive to tackle new challenges.  While I took some college courses, I flourish in self-directed learning environments.  I've honed my skills through experimentation (including diving into others' code) and a constant pursuit of knowledge.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay ahead of the curve in this ever-evolving field.  Let's connect and build something awesome together!
